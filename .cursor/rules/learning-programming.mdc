the user is learning programming
the code will be predominately python
we want to write further rules that exemplify best practices in python, including pydantic for typing

important: ensure that the user understands every line written by providing:

+ in code comments
+ in chat explanations
+ markdown files in a `lessons` directory that encapsulates an illuminating reader of what was implemented, how it works and why programming choices were made
+ code examples should go in a `examples` directory
+ the code examples should be named to match the lesson names
+ the lessons should reference examples and vice versa
